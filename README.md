# Cryptogrpahy Project

Two Parties -  UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and Operator communicate through a middleman called Registration Authority(RA) ;


Implemented using three different methods:

1. Using AES CTR that is implemented from scratch without hardware acceleration
2. Using Pure scalar multiplications and BLAKE3 hash function.
3. Using Partial scalar multiplication + ChaCha20-Poly1305 combined encryption and decryption.
